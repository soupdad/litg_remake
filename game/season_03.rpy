-Race you!
s03_mc " Last one there has to clean the pool!"
H/B/camilo "Wait, wh‚Ä¶"
You're already off and running.
Seconds later, you hear him laugh, then the sound of his bare feet on the grass as he gives chase.

-Why don't you carry me?
H/B/camilo "Carry you?"
s03_mc " That's what I said."
s03_mc " You can do it, right? Or are these muscles just for show?"
(Only B/Cam)He smirks and flexes his impressives arms.
(Only Harry): Muscles?
(Harry) He looks down at his arms and gives them an optimistic flex.
H/B/camilo "Of course I can do it. Just watch."
(Only Harry) He stretches a bit more, positions himself carefully, then scoops you up in his arms.
(Only Harry) He's stronger than he looks.
(Only B/Cam) He puts one hand on your back, scoops the other under your legs, and effortlessly sweeps you off your feet.
H/B/camilo "To the challenge platform, m'lady?"
s03_mc " To the challenge platform at once!"
He sets off, carrying you bridal-style across the lawn.

" It's only day 1, and MC is already turning heads all over the Villa!"
(If you choose the gem choice to kiss your partner)
" I think that snog might be one for the record books."
" Five minutes from first sight to first kiss?"
" The other girls will never catch up!"
" She's coupled up with Harry/Bill/Camilo for now, but who knows what could happen at this afternoon's challenge?"
elladine " We've got to kiss the boy we think the clue is about."
M (MC coupled with Harry/Camilo)/ G (MC coupled with Bill): I can't believe how big that is‚Ä¶
